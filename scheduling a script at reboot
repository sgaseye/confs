start script at boot for kali linux

I'm running Kali Linux 2018.1 on a VM. I want to run a bunch of commands that I have stored in the file start.sh at startup. I know how to do this on a normal distro by going into /etc/rc.local, but that doesn't exist in Kali.

Here are some of the commands I want to run.

apt-get clean && apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
openvas-start
/etc/init.d/nessusd start

Any suggestions?


You can add this script to /etc/crontab:

@reboot /path/to/your/start.sh

From man 5 crontab:

@reboot    :    Run once after reboot.


    I'm in the file /etc/crontab. Do I add "@reboot/path/start.sh" to the end of the file and then add "@reboot : Run once after reboot" after that? – 

    Yes, add script in format that I've written. –

    This is great-- I personally never knew crontab had support for scheduled tasks on reboot. – 







Had the same problem, found a solution in this post elsewhere.

Summary:

sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/rc-local.service

Then add the following content to it.

[Unit]
 Description=/etc/rc.local Compatibility
 ConditionPathExists=/etc/rc.local

[Service]
 Type=forking
 ExecStart=/etc/rc.local start
 TimeoutSec=0
 StandardOutput=tty
 RemainAfterExit=yes
 SysVStartPriority=99

[Install]
 WantedBy=multi-user.target

Note: Starting with 16.10, Ubuntu doesn’t ship with /etc/rc.local file anymore. Same thing for other distributions like Kali. You can create the file by executing this command.

printf '%s\n' '#!/bin/bash' 'exit 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/rc.local

Then add execute permission to /etc/rc.local file.

sudo chmod +x /etc/rc.local

After that, enable the service on system boot:

sudo systemctl enable rc-local

Finally, start the service and check its status:

sudo systemctl start rc-local.service
sudo systemctl status rc-local.service
