How to Uninstall Software on Kali Linux





You can use the dpkg command to see a list of all installed packages on your computer.

dpkg --list

To uninstall a program use apt command. For example, the following command uninstall gimp and deletes all the configuration file, using the --purge command.

sudo apt --purge remove gimp

If you don’t want to remove the configuration files, simply leave out the --purge command, as shown int the following command.

sudo apt remove gimp

When you uninstall a program, there may be packages that the uninstalled program depended upon that are no longer used. To remove nay unused packages, use the automove command, as shown in the following command.

sudo apt-get autoremove

You can combine the two commands for removing a program and removing dependencies that are no longer being used into one, as shown below.

sudo apt purge --auto-remove gimp

If you’re short on space, you can use the clean command to remove downloaded archive files,as shown below.

sudo apt clean

This command removes the aptitude cache in /var/cache/apt/archives. When you install a program, the package file is downloaded and stored in that directory. You don’t need to keep the files in that directory. However, the only drawback of deleting them, is that if you decide to install any of those programs again, the packages would have to be downloaded again.
