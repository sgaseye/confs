In order to read the password backup file we have to escalate the privileges. After exploring a bit more Kay’s directories we found ssh keys as shown in figure 1.15 below:
Figure 1.15

Save the keys on your machine in a file either using nano or editor you like.

Now run ssh2john tool to get the hash of the keys.

    python /usr/share/john/ssh2john.py sshkeys.txt > sshkeyshash.txt

Figure 1.16

Now run John the ripper tool to crack the passphrase for the account of Kay.

    john --wordlist=rockyou.txt sshkeyshash.txt

I have copied rockyou.txt file in my desktop directory just to idnore writing full path.

Now access the Kay’s ssh using the public keys of Kay account.

    ssh -i /home/kay/.ssh/id_rsa kay@10.10.83.60

Figure 1.18

We tried to access Kay’s ssh directly but unsuccessful. Let’s try to access from Jan’s account. First login ssh of jan account then type same command:
Figure 1.19

Here we go we have successfully logged in into Kay’s ssh, now lets go to that password backup file and read the content of it.
Figure 1.20

We have finally got the password and here the challenge is completed.

Lets try to escalate the privilege from kay’s account. First we have to check what privileges Kay have by using command:
