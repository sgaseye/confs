if Windows 💠:

"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-13.0.2\bin\java.exe" -javaagent:BurpSuiteLoader_v2021.8.jar -noverify -jar burpsuite_pro_v2021.8.jar

NB: Java version 9+ required [ filehorse.com/download-java-development-kit-64/46499/download ]





[[[[[[install burp suite from the .sh file downloaded from portswigger.net website 
now copy the burp loader file from the crack and paste it into thbe folder created by installation of burp suite i.e. Burpsuite pro
now you have to work with 2 files i.e. Burp loader file and burpsuite_pro.jar file byh stating them in command as shown below

java -javaagent:BurpSuiteLoader_v2021.8.jar -noverify -jar burpsuite_pro.jar]]]]]]




if Linux 🐧:

open burp
           👇🏼
java -javaagent:BurpSuiteLoader_v2021.8.jar -noverify -jar burpsuite_pro_v2021.8.jar

open keygen(activator) 
                   👇🏼
java -jar burploader-old.jar

Then follow video https://t.me/burpsuite/188 above to activate. 🏅

3. If you have problems with activate license, you should use to reactivate old burploader (for older versions like 2.1.07). Run:

java -jar burploader-old.jar

4. activate burp license manually with burploader-old.jar:

copy license request from loaded burpsuite_pro_v2021.8.jar to burploader-old, copy license response and paste to BurpSuite, press next. Done.

P.S.: There we use the same loader as in 2020.4 version (https://github.com/x-Ai/BurpSuiteLoader).

P.P.S.: burp/StartBurp has been compiled by a new version of the Java Runtime (class file version 53.0).
You should use java9+

P.P.P.S.: If you have a problems with activation, try activate 2020.12 version, it could help you.
